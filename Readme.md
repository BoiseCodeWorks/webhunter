## The Setup

---------------------------------------------------------------

You know the drill we need an application that will allow users to play a text based adventure using the mystical `HTTP` Methods. The basic setup for the application has been stubbed out with interfaces and it will be your responsibility to create the necessary classes and implement each of the interfaces appropriately. 


### Step 2 - Control the Game Loop
After building the game in the setup, you will need to continually take in user input. Make sure your game loop takes in the user input, handles it updating the game state (changing a room, taking an item, etc.) then takes in a new user command.

Because of how the interfaces are setup, you should be able to follow the pattern that has been laid out to build this functionality over several methods in the `App` class.
